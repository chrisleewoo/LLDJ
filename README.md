Love Looper DJ: The looping track-by-joypad synth and sequencer for Love2D
My latest YALP:
  "Yet Another LSDJ Wannabe" 

Built off of the Denver waveform library: https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=79499

Thanks to SuperZazu for creating it!

This project is to help me familiarize myself with the audio capabilities of the Love2D engine, as well as to learn some Lua scripting. 

This program can:
  generate audible waveforms
  apply effects
  play with keyboard controls
  change waveforms and octaves
  
 To Do:
 Build sequencer
 Create GUI
