number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.


chorus
    Plays multiple copies of the sound with slight pitch and time variation. Used to make sounds sound "fuller" or "thicker".

  number          phase          -180 -> 180    degrees
  number          rate            0.0 -> 10.0   mod rate
  number          depth           0.0 -> 1.0    amount
  number          feedback       -1.0 -> 1.0    amount (negative reverses phase)
  number          delay           0.0 -> 0.016  seconds

compressor
    Decreases the dynamic range of the sound, making the loud and
    quiet parts closer in volume, producing a more uniform amplitude    throughout time.
  The only parameter is boolean enable

distortion
    Alters the sound by amplifying it until it clips, shearing off 
    parts of the signal, leading to a compressed and distorted sound.

  number  bandwidth   80.0 -> 24k   Hz

echo
    Decaying feedback based effect, on the order of seconds. Also 
    known as delay; causes the sound to repeat at regular intervals 
    at a decreasing volume.

  value   name        range         actual values
      
  number  delay       0.0 -> 0.207  seconds*

  number  feedback    0.0 -> 1.0    feedback amount
  number  spread      -1.0 -> 1.0   panning amount (0 is center)

equalizer
    Adjust the frequency components of the sound using a 4-band (low-
    shelf, two band-pass and a high-shelf) equalizer.
  
  value   name              range           actual values
  
  number  lowgain           0.126 -> 7.943  cut or boost (1.0 is no gain)
  number  lowmidgain        0.126 -> 7.943  cut or boost (1.0 is no gain)
  number  highmidgain       0.126 -> 7.943  cut or boost (1.0 is no gain)
  number  highgain          0.126 -> 7.943  cut or boost (1.0 is no gain)
  number  lowmidbandwidth   0.01 -> 1.0     width
  number  highmidbandwidth  0.01 -> 1.0     width
  number  lowcut             50.0 -> 800.0  Hz

  number  highmidfrequency  1k.0 -> 8k.0    Hz
  number  highcut           4k.0 -> 16k.0   Hz

flanger
    Plays two copies of the sound; while varying the phase, or 
    equivalently delaying one of them, by amounts on the order of 
    milliseconds, resulting in phasing sounds.
  
  value           name         range         actual values

  number          depth       0.0 -> 1.0     pitch modulation ratio
  number          feedback   -1.0 -> 1.0     negative reverses phase

reverb
    Decaying feedback based effect, on the order of milliseconds. 
    Used to simulate the reflection off of the surroundings.

ringmodulator
    An implementation of amplitude modulation; multiplies the source 
    signal with a simple waveform, to produce either volume changes, 
    or inharmonic overtones.
