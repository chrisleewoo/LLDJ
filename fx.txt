number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.


chorus
    Plays multiple copies of the sound with slight pitch and time variation. Used to make sounds sound "fuller" or "thicker".
  
  
  EffectWaveform  waveform    'sine', 'sawtooth', 'square', 'triangle'
  number phase
  number rate
  number depth
  number feedback
  number delay

compressor
    Decreases the dynamic range of the sound, making the loud and
    quiet parts closer in volume, producing a more uniform amplitude    throughout time.
  The only parameter is boolean enable

distortion
    Alters the sound by amplifying it until it clips, shearing off 
    parts of the signal, leading to a compressed and distorted sound.
  
  number gain
  number edge
  number lowcut
  number center
  number bandwidth

echo
    Decaying feedback based effect, on the order of seconds. Also 
    known as delay; causes the sound to repeat at regular intervals 
    at a decreasing volume.
    
  number delay
  number tapdelay
  number damping
  number feedback
  number spread

equalizer
    Adjust the frequency components of the sound using a 4-band (low-
    shelf, two band-pass and a high-shelf) equalizer.
    
  number lowgain
  number lowcut
  number lowmidgain
  number lowmidfrequency
  number lowmidbandwidth
  number highmidgain
  number highmidfrequency
  number highmidbandwidth
  number highgain
  number highcut

flanger
    Plays two copies of the sound; while varying the phase, or 
    equivalently delaying one of them, by amounts on the order of 
    milliseconds, resulting in phasing sounds.
  
  EffectWaveform  waveform    'sine', 'sawtooth', 'square', 'triangle'
  number phase
  number rate
  number depth
  number feedback
  number delay

reverb
    Decaying feedback based effect, on the order of milliseconds. 
    Used to simulate the reflection off of the surroundings.

  number  lategain
  number  latedelay
  number  roomrolloff
  number  airabsorption
  bool    highlimit

ringmodulator
    An implementation of amplitude modulation; multiplies the source 
    signal with a simple waveform, to produce either volume changes, 
    or inharmonic overtones.
